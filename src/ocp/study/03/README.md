# Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach

## Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection

blah blah blah

## Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers

## Implement overloading, including var-arg methods

blah blah blah

## Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, and make objects immutable

### Immutable Objects

#### Examples

![Examples](../../../../img/03_immutable_classes_example.png)

#### Advantages

1. Programs are less complicated
1. Thread-safe
1. Collections such as HashMap and HashSet expect immutability
1. Objects can be safely shared and reused


## Implement polymorphism and differentiate object type versus reference type. Perform type casting, identify object types using instanceof operator and pattern matching

blah blah blah

## Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods

blah blah blah

## Create and use enumerations with fields, methods and constructors

blah blah blah
