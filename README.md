_This documentation is an aggregation of multiple sources and is intended as a study guide for my personal use and such, wording and examples may jump between perspectives or may appear incomplete. I make no personal gain from this other than learning._

UPDATE: Many of the items in the exam are also in the Java SE 11 exam. I recommend anyone using this material to refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rysharprules/Java-SE11-Upgrade-Exam">exam notes for that</a>.
New language features for Java SE 17 will be placed within this repository ONLY.

# Exam Review

After passing this exam, I have added a <a href="https://rysharp.blogspot.com/2023/09/1z0-829-exam-review.html" target="_blank">review on my blog</a>. I hope it helps.
